id,name,description,data to fetch from GitHub API,how to compute the rating from the data,status,additional notes
A1,Useful volume,Number of merged PRs (excluding repos owned by the user) over the lookback window.,"search PRs: is:pr author:{login} merged:>=from repo.owner.login != user.login; fields: createdAt, mergedAt, repository{owner{login}}, number",Compute total -> convert to cohort percentile (tech). Rating = 1 + floor(percentile*19).,done,Prefer total count for efficiency; weekly caps require per-PR timestamps.
A2,Efficiency (merge rate),Merge rate for PRs opened in the window (excluding user repos).,"search PRs: is:pr author:{login} created:>=from repo.owner.login != user.login -is:draft; fields: state, mergedAt",merge_rate = merged/opened (opened = all created in window) -> cohort percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Ensure merged is computed on the same created>=from cohort.
A3,Velocity (p95 time-to-merge),p95 time between createdAt and mergedAt (smaller is better).,"search merged PRs: is:pr author:{login} merged:>=from repo.owner.login != user.login; fields: createdAt, mergedAt",t = p95(mergedAt-createdAt); inverse: pct = 1-percentile(t); Rating 1-20.,todo,If no merged PRs in window, rating is null. Clamp to 14 days to avoid extreme durations.
A4,Cleanliness (no changes requested),% of merged PRs without CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews (excluding user repos).,pullRequest{ reviewDecision reviews(states:CHANGES_REQUESTED){totalCount} repository{owner{login}} },ratio_clean = merged_without_CR / merged -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Count only reviews before mergedAt.
A5,Self-resolved issues,Issues you created that are later closed by your PRs.,issue(author:USER) linked to pullRequest(author:USER) via closingIssuesReferences,ratio = issues_by_you_closed_by_your_PR / issues_by_you_total -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Merged from A5/D4; focuses on end-to-end ownership.
A6,External merges,% of PRs merged by an external maintainer (not you and not your org).,pullRequest{ mergedBy{login} repository{ owner{ login } } author{login} } + org membership,ratio_ext = merged_by_external / merged_total -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,External = mergedBy != author and mergedBy not in your organization.
B1,Reviews given,Number of reviews you leave on other people's PRs.,contributionsCollection{ pullRequestReviewContributions{ nodes{ occurredAt pullRequest{ author{login} } }}} (filter author != user),total -> cohort percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Use log1p to compress if needed before percentile.
B2,Reviews received,Number of reviews received on your PRs.,pullRequest{ reviews{ totalCount } } on your PRs,total -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Optional if you prefer balance with B4.
B3,Review acceptance,Share of your reviews followed by a quick merge (<= N days).,pullRequestReviewContributions{ nodes{ occurredAt pullRequest{ mergedAt }}},accept_rate = count(mergedAt-occurredAt <= N) / reviews_given -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Exclude self-review (author != user). N=7 days by default.
B4,Author responsiveness,p95 time between first review received and your first response (comment/commit).,"pullRequest{ timelineItems(itemTypes:[REVIEWED,ISSUE_COMMENTED,COMMITTED]){ nodes{ ... on PullRequestReview{ createdAt } ... on IssueComment{ createdAt author{login} } ... on Commit{ committedDate author{user{login}} }}}}",calc delta p95; inverse: pct = 1-percentile(delta) -> 1-20.,todo,Filter to your responses (author=you).
B5,Review relevance,Quality of your review comments (length + presence of code blocks).,pullRequestReviewContributions{ nodes{ pullRequestReview{ body }}} or comments body,score_text = mean(1*(words>=N) + 1*(contains_code_block)); -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,N~20 words; detect ``` in body.
C1,Active days per week,Number of distinct days with >=1 contribution (cap at 5).,contributionsCollection{ contributionCalendar{ weeks{ contributionDays{ date contributionCount }}}},mean weekly days (cap 5) -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Exclude issues to avoid bot noise. Do not reward 7/7.
C2,EMA regularity,EMA of active days per week (smoothing alpha~=0.3).,Same data as C1 across successive weeks,ema_t = alpha*x_t + (1-alpha)*ema_{t-1} -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Window 8-12 weeks.
C3,Weekly stability,Low variance of volume (PR+reviews+issues) week to week.,Weekly counts of PR/reviews/issues,variance -> inverse: pct = 1-percentile(variance) -> 1-20.,todo,Robust to empty weeks (ignore if variance very low).
C4,Recency of activity,Heavier weight for recent contributions (decay).,Timestamps of all contributions,score = sum exp(-delta_t/tau) over 12 weeks -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,tau~=4 weeks.
D1,External engagement,Unique non-affiliated commenters on your issues/PRs.,issue/PR comments{ nodes{ author{login} } } + affiliation,unique_external_commenters -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Measures interest outside your circle.
D2,Repo impact,Impact of repos where your PRs are merged (stars/forks normalized by age).,repository{ stargazerCount forkCount createdAt },impact_repo = 0.6*log1p(stars)/age + 0.4*log1p(forks)/age; then weighted average -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Normalize impact within cohort; age in years, age>=1.
D3,Maintainer trust,Roles/permissions obtained (triage/collaborator/member) weighted by repo/org impact.,"collaborator status, organization membership, repository affiliation",trust = sum weight(role)*impact_repo_norm -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Weights: member>collaborator>triage; multiply by normalized repo/org impact.
E1,CI pass rate,% of SUCCESS checks on your merged PRs.,pullRequest{ commits(last:1){ nodes{ commit{ statusCheckRollup{ contexts{ nodes{ ... on CheckRun{ conclusion } ... on StatusContext{ state } }}}}}}},success/total -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Ignore PRs without checks (or neutralize).
E2,Tests touched,% of test files modified in your PRs.,pullRequest{ files(first:100){ nodes{ path } } },ratio_test_files -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Pattern: __tests__|\.spec\.|\.test\. Paginate files for large PRs or mark as approximate.
E3,PR lead time,Time between first commit of the PR and merge (smaller is better).,pullRequest{ commits(first:1){ nodes{ commit{ committedDate }}} mergedAt },delta = mergedAt-firstCommit; inverse: 1-percentile(delta) -> 1-20.,todo,Clamp to 30 days.
E4,Security (dependency PRs),Dependency-related PRs (e.g., dependabot or security label) closed/merged.,pullRequest{ author{login} labels{name} mergedAt closedAt },score = merged_or_closed_security_PRs -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,author.login == 'dependabot[bot]' OR label =~ /security/i.
E5,Coverage proxy (tests delta),Test lines added/modified relative to total lines changed.,pullRequest{ additions deletions files{ path additions deletions } },ratio = test_lines_changed / total_lines_changed -> percentile -> 1-20.,todo,Paginate files for large PRs or mark as approximate if only file-level granularity is available.
